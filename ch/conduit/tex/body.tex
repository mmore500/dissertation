This chapter develops the Conduit C++ library for best-effort communication in parallel and distributed high-performance computing and tests it through a series of on-hardware experiments.
We find that the best-effort approach significantly increases performance at high CPU count.
Because real-time volatility affects the outcome of computation under the best-effort model, we additionally designed and measured a suite of quality of service metrics.
Scaling experiments show that median quality of service generally remains stable as CPU count increases.
