\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we introduced a specialized reimplementation of the SignalGP library for event-driven genetic programming called SignalGP-Lite.
Designed to cater to artificial life applications, the SignalGP-Lite library streamlines agents by reducing control flow overhead and trading run-time flexibility for better performance due to compile-time configuration.
We showed through benchmarking experiments how these distinctions, stemming from fundamental aspects of the re-implementation, enable an order-of-magnitude speedup.
Further, through two benchmark problems from foundational work with SignalGP, we demonstrate solution quality equivalent to SignalGP.
SignalGP-Lite has already been adopted in an ongoing artificial life project, the DISHTINY digital multicellularity framework.
Because of its distinctive capabilities, free distribution of this software enables new opportunities within artificial life and other specialized applications of genetic programming.
