\section{Abstract}

Event-driven genetic programming representations have been shown to outperform traditional imperative representations on interaction-intensive problems.
The event-driven approach organizes genome content into modules that are triggered in response to environmental signals, simplifying simulation design and implementation.
Existing work developing event-driven genetic programming methodology has largely used the SignalGP framework, which caters to traditional program synthesis applications.
The SignalGP-Lite library provides a specialized implementation of the SignalGP framework that caters to multi-agent applications, especially those characteristic of artificial life research.
SignalGP-Lite enables larger-scale artificial life experiments by streamlining agents through simplified control flow and reduced run-time configuration flexibility (in favor of better-performing compile-time configuration).
Here, we report benchmarking experiments that show an 8x to 30x speedup over original SignalGP implementations.
We also report solution quality equivalent to SignalGP on two benchmark problems originally developed to test the ability of evolved programs to respond to a large number of signals and to modulate signal response based on context.
