This chapter is adapted from ~\citep{moreno2021exploring}, which appeared in the Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution Models in Ecology and Evolution special issue, Digital Evolution: Insights for Biologists.

This chapter introduces the DISHTINY framework, which enables evolution experiments with digital multicells.
Indeed, in evolutionary experiments, we repeatedly observed group-level traits that are characteristic of a fraternal transition.
These included reproductive division of labor, resource sharing within kin groups, resource investment in offspring groups, asymmetrical behaviors mediated by messaging, morphological patterning, and adaptive apoptosis.
We report eight case studies from replicates where transitions occurred and explore the diverse range of adaptive evolved multicellular strategies.
