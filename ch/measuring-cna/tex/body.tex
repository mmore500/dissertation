This chapter is adapted from ~\citep{moreno2021case}, which underwent peer review and appeared in the proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Open-Ended Evolution (OEE4) at the 2021 Conference on Artificial Life (ALIFE 2021).

This chapter reports trajectories of novelty, complexity, and adaptation in a case study from the DISHTINY simulation system.
This case study lineage produced ten qualitatively distinct multicellular morphologies, several of which exhibit asymmetrical growth and distinct life stages.
We find that a loose --- sometimes divergent --- relationship can exist among novelty, complexity, and adaptation.
