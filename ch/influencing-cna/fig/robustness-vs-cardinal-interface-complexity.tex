\caption{
Robustness and cardinal interface complexity for strains sampled from 40 replicates across 100 three hour evolutionary stints at 10 stint intervals.
Interface complexity counts the number of distinct adaptive interactions a behavior exhibits with the environment or other agents.
Individual observations are fully independent, computed as means over stints per replicate trial.
Shaded regions are 95\% confidence intervals.
