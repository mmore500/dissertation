\section{Event-driven vs. Sensor-driven Genetic Encoding}

\section{Alternate Proposals}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Role of sexual recombination (too broad)
  \item Role of ecology
  \item Selecting for multicell ``functionality''
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Idea: motility
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Increase resource collection rate based on distance from which kin group ID originated
      \item Idea: distributed sensing
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Generate an underlying state (T/F) for each kin group id,
      \item Each cell can sense the underlying state, but with an unreliable sensor
      \item Increase resource collection rate based on consensus for the correct underlying state
      \item Could also try some sort of pattern sensing (vertical vs horizontal stripes, etc)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Idea: Resource exchange
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Generate and randomly distribute resource ``tokens''
      \item ``Tokens'' may be beneficial or harmful when ``cashed in,'' based on kin group ID (i.e., good for some groups harmful for others)
      \item Allow cells (and groups) to exchange tokens
      \item This could simulate “trading” between groups or “specialization” within groups
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
